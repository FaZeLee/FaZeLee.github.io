              Chang Lee was born and raised in the industrial heart of Guangzhou, China, where his family ran a modest but respected automotive parts factory. His father, Li Wei Lee, had built the business from the ground up, manufacturing components for cars and trucks, supplying local auto shops and repair centers. The factory wasn’t large, but it was enough to provide for the family and employ a few dozen workers, many of whom had been with the Lees for years. Chang grew up surrounded by the hum of machinery and the scent of motor oil, learning everything there was to know about engines and manufacturing.

              From a young age, Chang worked alongside his father, gaining both technical skills and a deep understanding of how to run the business. His father was a hands-on leader who believed in quality and hard work, and he expected nothing less from his son. Chang learned how to manage workers, negotiate deals, and maintain machinery, preparing for the day when he would take over the factory.

              By his late twenties, Chang had assumed many of the factory's day-to-day operations, freeing his father to focus on bigger strategic decisions. The business was doing well, and Chang had plans to expand, introducing new technology to streamline production and increase output. For a while, life seemed stable, even prosperous.

              But Guangzhou was changing. As the city grew, so did its problems. Organized crime, in the form of powerful triads, began targeting local businesses, demanding protection money. The Lees’ factory, with its steady income, became a prime target. At first, Chang and his father resisted the extortion, believing that they could rely on the law to protect them. But the police were either corrupt or too afraid to act. Soon, threats turned into sabotage—machines were vandalized, shipments were delayed, and workers were harassed.

              The triads weren’t just after money—they wanted control. They saw potential in the automotive industry and sought to use the factory as a front for their own illegal activities, smuggling stolen vehicles and car parts. One night, after refusing yet another demand for protection money, the factory was set ablaze. Chang and his father managed to save some equipment, but the damage was done. It was clear that staying in Guangzhou was no longer an option.

              With little choice, Chang’s father made the heartbreaking decision to sell what was left of the factory and flee to America, seeking a fresh start far from the grip of organized crime. The family settled in Los Santos, California, hoping to rebuild their lives in a city known for its opportunities, but also its own dangers.

              Los Santos was a world apart from Guangzhou. The sprawling city was filled with fast cars, crowded streets, and a mix of cultures that both fascinated and overwhelmed Chang. They had come to escape the criminal elements of China, but it didn’t take long to realize that crime was just as much a part of life in Los Santos as it had been back home.

              Chang found work in a local auto repair shop, where his skills were quickly recognized. He earned a reputation for his expertise in engine repair and his knowledge of car parts, making him a valuable asset in the competitive world of Los Santos’ automotive industry. However, the legitimate work was barely enough to make ends meet. The dream of reopening an automotive factory seemed further and further out of reach.

              Then, through connections in the city’s Chinese community, Chang found an opportunity to re-enter the manufacturing world, though not in the way he had hoped. A local businessman with ties to the black market approached him with a proposition—restart the automotive parts business, but with a twist. They would produce legitimate parts by day, but at night, the factory would be used to dismantle stolen cars and create custom components for street racers and illegal car rings.

              At first, Chang was hesitant. His father had always valued honesty and hard work, and the idea of becoming involved in the criminal underworld weighed heavily on him. But the lure of returning to the business he loved, combined with the harsh economic reality of life in Los Santos, pushed him to make a decision. He agreed, telling himself that it was only temporary, a way to survive until he could go fully legitimate.

              Now, Chang Lee runs a small but growing automotive parts factory on the outskirts of Los Santos. By day, they manufacture high-quality car parts for local garages and dealerships. But by night, the factory transforms into a hub for illegal car modifications and parts trafficking. Chang walks a fine line, trying to balance his desire to uphold his father’s legacy with the need to survive in a city where playing by the rules isn’t always an option.

              Chang’s life is a constant struggle between his past and his present. He longs to rebuild the honest business his father once ran, but the realities of Los Santos keep pulling him deeper into a world of crime. Each day, he tells himself that one more deal will be enough to set things right—that eventually, he’ll find a way out. But deep down, he knows that the further he goes, the harder it will be to escape.

              For now, Chang remains focused on keeping his family safe and his factory running, even as the line between right and wrong becomes blurrier with each passing day. He lives with the guilt of his choices but also with the hope that one day, he can reclaim the life he and his father once dreamed of, far from the shadow of crime that has followed him from Guangzhou to Los Santos.
